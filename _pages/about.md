# Who are we?

This website was an idea to post useful scripting concepts for beginners and experts to share their ideas and examples. Too often we have been given half of what is needed and still missing pieces. Some of the goals here are to create articles that explain and show examples of the concept in the post.

# Whatâ€™s next?

We would love to have some assistance in writing articles for our readers. This brings a diverse set of skills and knowledge to our platform. Feel free to contact us if interested.

Soon it would be nice to add a membership levels for certain content and tutorials.
